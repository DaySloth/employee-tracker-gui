## Description 

Being a manager can be a hard job, especially when it comes to having to find employee contact information. This Employee Information Gui app was built to help releive some of those stresses. This page will display a list of employees, an image, their name, email address, phone number and date of birth. This will help you find someone's contact info very quickly.

## Usage

You can visit the [Link](https://employee-tracker-gui.herokuapp.com/) provided and this will take you to the Heroku deployed application. This page is just loaded with bogus info from a user API to help display a concept. You are presented with an image, name, email, phone number and date of birth for each employee. Clicking on the DOB section will allow you to toggle between sorting 'Ascending' or 'Descending' order. Ther is also a search option to search for employees by name.
